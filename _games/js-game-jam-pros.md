comment: If you're looking to make the game a bit more suspenseful, you can add some music and sound effects to keep the player on their toes. It might also be helpful to add some instructions at the start of the game to tell the player what they are expected to do and how they will be controlling the character. Finally, a nice to have would be to explain to the player what the premise behind the game is, i.e. the motivation for them to collect plastic.
