comment: Very nice graphics, I would play this game any time. The sound effects at the end of the level are fetching, you could also add some music/sound effects for the main part of the game too, e.g. every time the shark loses a point, the player hears a negative sound and the positive points are announced with a positive sound. The timer is a good idea - it adds a bit of challenge and suspense to the game.
