comment: The game is very replayable, which is great! It might be helpful to add some short instructions at the start to tell the player what the premise of the game is and what they need to do to progress. I appreciate that the player also can learn some of these instructions through trial and error as well, so the instructions don't need to be particularly detailed. The music suits the game well. The level of challenge was well tuned.
