description: Research is an integral part of making games fun and accessible to a wide range of players. Academics working in the video games research field explore what makes video games engaging, why players choose to play certain games, why some games are more popular than others. We can also think about how we can use games to teach players certain skills or motivate players to change their behaviour or attitudes, amongst many other topics. In this talk, Alena will share her experience of working with players and video game developers to learn more about these research topics.
