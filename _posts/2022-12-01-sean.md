description: Making a profit from an indie game is challenging and requires hard work and a bit of luck. So, is it possible to pay the rent (and eat) while making indie games which have not blown up on Steam? In this talk Sean will share his experience making indie games for the past 5 years alongside a full-time job. What are the pros and cons of running an indie studio on the side, and is it a good idea?
