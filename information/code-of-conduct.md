### Always welcome jammers who you don’t know

Some people feel very nervous doing new things where they don’t know people. Always be inclusive to all people. Reach out to those around you who are discovering the joy of making games.

### Be respectful of different ideas and experiences

Did you know everyone sees the world differently? That is a beautiful thing. We should celebrate each other’s views. Focus on respecting each other, even if you disagree with what they say.

### Be respectful of the space you are in and the tools you have

You have been invited to take part in this jam by the event leader. Make sure you thank them by respecting the environment you are learning in, and the tools you have for making games. Behave sensibly, calmly and safely even if you feel frustrated. 

### Be ready to learn

You must always seek to learn more about your game-making. You may become really good at a particular skill, but there are always new skills to learn which will be very rewarding. 

### Ask for help

Ask for support when you need it, and be brave enough to offer support to others when you find yourself able to. Share what you have made and what you know about making with others.

### Be brave and speak up

Should anything in the jam make you feel unsafe, uncomfortable, insulted, intimidated, harassed, unwelcome, threatened, or negative in any other way, speak with a teacher from your school or the event leader - [jared.rigby@dulwich.org](mailto:jared.rigby@dulwich.org) - immediately.
